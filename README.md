My old cat just past away

She is special, I have adopted many cats before, but they were all kittens when I got them from other families. 
This was a stray cat, and she is the only cat I know that died because of so old, to the point that her body cannot keep living, she is not just a wild cat, but a really wise cat.

--- 

My mother met her when she was already mature. I thought she was hungry and was moving around from house to house before she received food from my family.

That how stray cats always lived in the wild. 

You know, in despite of being a carnivore, with me a cat lived a life similar to like a monk than our human. It lived in its free wild, if a human is nice enough to feed them, they will try to live nice with them, if not, they will try to survive by themselves.

But no matter how they seem to keep attached to you, in the end they will choose to die alone.

It is a pure way to live, don't like how pathetic our humans are when try to group together and build a civil society.

She has lived with us for more than five years, and if she is already a woman with multi times of giving birth before she met us, she must be more than ten years old.

Nearly two years ago, all the offspring she gave become premature. 

After some unsuccessful attempts to bear new children,  she stopped attracting male cats and giving any new birth.

I started to notice that she become thinner, slower; her back grew a hunch.

She cannot hide her claws in her feet like young ones anymore. 

Her fur started to shed, and her skin has a turtle-shell that is unable to recover.

She stopped fighting with any young but unfamiliar cats from the neighbour that try to steal some food from hers, which was never a things when she was young and need food for both her and her child. She simply ignored them or sometimes gave them a warm invite by licking them.

One week ago, I noticed that she avoided jumping to the walk. 

Two days ago, she ate only one time with little food.

One day ago, she stopped eating.

And today, a rainy day, she didn't appear.

---

She is a very wise cat, you should have known, cats rarely die old, you barely know that they could grow old, their wild way of life makes most of them die young, and when they die, they never stay in your house's area

But she was so careful throughout her life, I still remember how she only moves around our house and never adventures to the neighbours.

She always keeps a distance from me despite that I am the one that she knew she can trust the most.

That is how she can survive that long. 

Wiser than the Icarus,

Braver than most heroes,

And honorable that most of the Queens.

Rip her, rip my cat, a mother, a true strong woman, I never gave you a name after all those years we spent time together. 

And after you passed away, I never had a change to see where your grave was.
